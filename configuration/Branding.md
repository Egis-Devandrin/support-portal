# Branding PaperTrail 


-   Images are placed in the System/images node.
-   Images must end in .png (if they are a .jpeg or .gif they can be
    safely renamed).
-   Images should be the correct size, if the image is bigger or smaller
    it should be manually resized before importing into System/images.
-   To prevent the images from being overwritten after upgrades, they
    should be permanently checked out.
