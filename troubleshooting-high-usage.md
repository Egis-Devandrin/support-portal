# Troubleshooting High CPU usage



\#\# Before doing anything else





Before restarting PaperTrail always try and get a snapshot:



\`http://localhost:8080/snapshot\`  



and/or a thread dump  



\`http://localhost:8080/snapshot/threads\`



If the web interface is unresponsive, use the command line to retrieve a

thread dump.



On Linux: \`/etc/init.d/papertrail heap\`  

On Windows: In &lt;Java Bin Directory&gt;,  Run \`jps\` to get the PID of the service and then \`jstack -dump:format=b,file=C:\heap.bin  &lt;PID&gt;\`



\#\# Common Causes of high CPU usage



If a single CPU core is at 100%, the culprit would normally be single thread that reoccurs in every single thread dump.



If all CPU cores are at 100% or near 100%, the cause is either:



a\) memory exhaustion - very little free memory,  \`jstat\`  would return

very high garbage collection times \(GC\)  

b\) an endless loop  

c\) too many worker threads and/or too few cores

  



\#\# Analyzing a Thread Dump



Analyzing a thread dump involves looking through all the threads on the

running system to identify a pattern.



\*  Any thread in a \`TIMED\_WAITING\` or \`WAITING\` state can be safely ignored

as these threads are sleeping waiting for something else to occur.



\*  Jetty threads in the \`java.net.SocketInputStream.socketRead RUNNING \`state can also be ignored as they are waiting for a client to make a TCP/IP connection
