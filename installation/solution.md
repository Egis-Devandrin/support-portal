## Deploying Solutions

1. First take a full [backup](../configuration/backups-text.md) if possible.
2. NB: Turn on [Maintenance Mode](../reference/maintenance-text.md)

Note : A SolutionPack.zip is used in the examples below, however each solution will have it's own filename e.g.  Travel.zip, HR.zip

### Via the CLI

`pt deploy SolutionPack.zip`

### Via the GUI

* Go to the Admin > Services > Tasks > Bulk Import > Deploy Pack
* Select the **SolutionPack.zip**
* Then conduct a [Health Check](../reference/health-text.md)
* Finally turn off [Maintenance Mode](../reference/maintenance-text.md)
