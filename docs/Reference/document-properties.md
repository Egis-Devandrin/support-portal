## Writable Properties

Some document properties are also editable, but most are read only.

*   filename
*   visibility
*   title
*   subject
*   {custom_index}

to set a writeable property you can use a script:  

`doc.metadata().set("title", "a new title")`

Or a updateIndex rule  

`title=new title`  

or using the HTTP API:  

`curl -x POST http://host/public/indexes/<docId>/?title= a new title`  

Document properties can also be updated via other mechanism for updating indexes including:

*   Import and Sync
*   .TXT files
*   .XML indexes

## Special properties

Due to the large number of places, indexes/properties can be updated. It being the single most common point of integration between systems, there are a few special properties that trigger actions. They are prefixed with `_` and not to be confused with normal properties that relate to metadata only.
