# Performance

## Check underlying system

1.  Is there enough memory?  There should always be at least 1 - 2GB
    free memory in production to avoid using swap space
2.  Is CPU Usage high? Then check the [CPU Usage guide](cpu-usage)
3.  Check network performance via ICMP ping and Browser developer tools
    network tab - Response times of < 250ms are good and < 1s are
    acceptable.
4.  Check the following resources for identifying lower level
    bottlenecks.
