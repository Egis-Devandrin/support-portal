* All documentation should be in South African English.
* Links should be relative, any hardcoded path to docs.papertrail.co.za should be converted to a relative path
* Use semantic markup e.g. `index1 == "other"` instead of **bold** for:
  * scripts
  * expressions
  * filenames
  * menu names
  * properties
  
* Use code blocks for:
  * file contents
  * sql/pql
 ```sql
 SELECT * FROM 'HELLO'
 ```
